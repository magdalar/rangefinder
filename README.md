rangefinder
===========

RangeFinder android app

This app is primarily a test application for me to learn Android and Wear development.

My initial goals are to create a Map interface in which the user selects a target destination,
and the app then shows the as-the-bird-flies distance to that destination, updated as the user
moves.

The Wear version of the app will then aim to show the same detail, the bird-flies distance to
the destination, as well as perhaps a directional indicator (NEWS, or compass bearing), and
maybe even an overview map.

Additional ideas:
  - Reverse geocoding of the target; show the address.
  - Perhaps even show place names.
  - Select a destination by search.
  - Select a destination by voice command, especially on Wear.

Real strech ideas:
  - Select a friend, and co-share locations to help meet people in crowds.
